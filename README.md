ISEE-3 Reboot Data
==================

These are sporadic recordings of raw telemetry from the
[ISEE-3 Reboot](http://spacecollege.org/isee3/ "ISEE-3 Reboot homepage")
project.

Useful for testing telemetry parsers when there's no live stream
available, or checking history.

Notes
=====

I noticed on 2014 Aug 11 that the telemetry timestamps were
about 200 seconds ahead of realtime.
E.g. 6:08:28:20.261 vs 06:05:09 UTC.
